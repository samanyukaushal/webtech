Report on Quiz Application Project Student Name: Samanyu Kaushal Roll Number: 20814803122 Class: 6IT9 AI/ML Branch: IT Submitted to: Prof. Narinder Kaur College Name: MAIT

Introduction The project is a full-fledged quiz application for testing a user's knowledge regarding a wide range of subjects. It shows multiple-choice questions, saves the user's responses, computes the score, and gives the results at the end of the quiz. The project further contains functionality for users to capture and post their quiz results. The program is made for use by everybody and gives a responsive experience. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for developing the front end, with logic being placed for implementing the quiz functionality.

Design Choices User Interface Design: The application interface is neat and simple and facilitates easy usage for everyone. The primary parts consist of

A start screen that welcomes the quiz and offers a button to start.

A sequence of multiple-choice questions, each with radio buttons for answer selection.

A results screen that displays the user's score upon finishing the quiz.

A share button to share the results as a screenshot.

Question Management: The quiz has a dynamic mechanism for presenting multiple-choice questions. Questions are kept in an array, making it simple to add or change them. Every question includes a question prompt and a list of potential answers. Users can choose an answer for every question, and the application records their choices.

Score Calculation: The score of the user is determined by comparing their chosen answers with the correct ones. After answering all the questions, the score is shown on the results page.

Interactivity and User Feedback:

Immediate Feedback: The user receives immediate feedback on their choice after answering each question. This informs them about what they did correctly or incorrectly.

Results Display: The total score is displayed after the quiz is taken, along with the option to retake the quiz or share the results.

Screenshot Capture Feature: The user has the option of capturing the quiz results as an image by using the HTML2Canvas library. This feature enables users to share their score by saving the result in the form of a PNG image.

Code Structure HTML Structure: The HTML structure is split into three sections:

Introduction Screen: Has a "Start Quiz" button.

Quiz Screen: Has each multiple-choice question with a list of possible answers and a "Next" button.

Results Screen: Has the total score, with choices to retake the quiz or share the results.

CSS Design: The CSS is in charge of making the user interface aesthetically pleasing. Major features include:

Centralized quiz content for a tidy layout.

Styled buttons to promote user interaction.

Various color schemes to separate different sections (e.g., quiz section, results section).

Responsive layout to make the application appear good on various screen sizes.

JavaScript Functionality:

Quiz Logic: The JavaScript manages quiz navigation (i.e., showing questions and answers), score calculation, and updating the UI accordingly. It also controls the logic for submitting answers and navigating through the quiz.

Screenshot Logic: JavaScript, utilizing the HTML2Canvas library, takes a screenshot of the results section and enables the user to save it as an image.

Challenges Faced and Solutions Dynamic Content Loading: The quiz content was static at first, i.e., the user couldn't dynamically engage with the questions. To overcome this, I designed an array of objects to hold the question text, options, and answers. I populated the questions and options dynamically on the page using JavaScript so that the quiz can be easily added to with new questions.

Ensuring Proper Answer Tracking: One of the challenges was properly tracking the user's answers. I addressed this by saving the chosen answers in an array and comparing them with the correct answers once all questions were answered. This enabled proper score calculation.

Enhancing User Experience: Users had problems to begin with in realizing that the quiz was done. To correct this, I included a results screen which showed not only the score but also had chances to retake the quiz or to share the results. This made it clear when the quiz was done.

Enabling Screenshot Capture: The functionality of capturing a screenshot of the results was tricky initially because HTML2Canvas was having some problems in rendering certain elements properly. As a remedy, I specifically targeted the results part for capture so that only content of interest was captured in the screenshot. A very small pause was introduced before capture to make sure everything was rendered completely.

Performance Optimization: The performance of the quiz was originally affected while dealing with huge volumes of content. To mitigate this, I optimized the JavaScript code so that unnecessary DOM manipulations were avoided. Moreover, the section for quiz results was separated for the screenshot capture in order to lower rendering load.

Conclusion This project illustrates an end-to-end, interactive quiz app with the ability to take a screenshot. The user interface focuses on ease of use by giving instant feedback, a neat and minimal design, and the ability to share results easily. The JavaScript algorithm efficiently manages the progression of a quiz, marking, and results display, whereas the HTML2Canvas library supports seamless screenshotting.

Overall, this project is a great demonstration of how web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to develop an interesting and useful quiz application. Development challenges were mainly centered around dealing with dynamic content and maintaining seamless interactivity, but these were successfully overcome by careful design and optimization.
